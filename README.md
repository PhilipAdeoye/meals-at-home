# Meals at Home
Beautiful React app for ordering delicious ready-to-eat meals. [Live Demo](https://philipadeoye.com/meals-at-home)


First "from scratch" React app bootstrapped with create-react-app.

Going into this project, my emphasis was on 

- Making it beautiful
- Keeping it super simple to use for anyone
- Cross-device/platform compatibility
- Using transitions and animations (CSS3 animations/gradients, react-transition-group)
- Learning new things (ES6+, flexbox, grid)
- and of course having quite a bit of fun
